# Handling Negative Values in Scala Class

This example showcases a common error handling scenario in Scala: preventing negative values from being assigned to a class member.

The `MyClass` demonstrates a simple way to handle this using a private variable and a setter method that throws an `IllegalArgumentException` if a negative value is attempted to be assigned.  This is a standard approach and generally effective.  However, alternative strategies could be explored for more nuanced error handling or for specific application requirements.  For example, consider logging the error, using a different exception type, or providing a default value.  The choice of approach should depend on the broader context of your application.

## Potential Improvements

* **More informative exception message:** Include the invalid value in the exception message for easier debugging.
* **Alternative error handling:** Instead of throwing an exception, the setter could clamp the value to zero or return a `Try` result.
* **Logging:** Add logging to record instances of invalid input.
* **Custom Exception:** Create a custom exception type for better error handling in your application.
